<div>
    <h1>DressApi</h1>
    The name "DressApi" means it "dress up" your database, substantially it provides a quick REST API, to your db schema. 
    ORM means "Object-relational mapping" and DressApi maps your database dynamically. Although it is structured as an MVC (Model, View, Controller) it does not need to define a model for each table in the DB but if it automatically reads it from the DB. 

    The most obvious advantage is that if the data structure changes over time, even significantly, the model fits automatically without touching a line of your code.
